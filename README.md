# Schematics-MV1F
 
Neo-Geo was introduced to the world on 1990.

The Neo Geo originally launched as the Multi Video System (MVS) coin-operated arcade machine. 

With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game cabinet can easily be changed to a different game title by swapping the game's cartridge and cabinet artwork.

The Neo Geo was marketed as the first 24-bit system; its CPU is actually a 16/32-bit 68000 with an 8-bit Z80 coprocessor, while its GPU chipset has a 24-bit graphics data bus. 

## Why this project

Until now, only poorly scanned documentation is available, despite an huge communities, no good scan or documents exist.
This project is trying to re-create schemactics for the MVS.
