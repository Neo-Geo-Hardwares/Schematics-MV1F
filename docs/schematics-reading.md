## Reading scanned schematics
On the scanned original schematics, there is some funny informations:

### Components identifications 

All majors components were identifed by an ID composed with 2 characters: an number from "1" to "9" and a letter from "A" to "L"; this _identification_ can be not unique.
in fact, it doesn't identify the component itself but the coordonate on the board, where the number identify the column and the letter the line.

It could be followed by a second letter, wich identify the "sub" part of the component (the second AND gate of a 74LS05 will be identifed as "5L**B**").
