### Errors and missconceptions

During the process of understanding, I've seen severals issues and typo error.

 * On Page 1, the 74HC32 (Quad 2-input OR Gates) use the 2 drawing convention for 2-input OR Gate, it's confusing.

 * On Page 3, another 74HC32 (Quad 2-input OR Gates) use the "alternative" drawing convention for an 2-input OR Gate, so far I didn't find any usage of the 3 other gates from this IC.

 * On Page 3, the pinout of the JAMMA's Blue (**B**) pin is correctly identified (**12**) and mislabelled as **GREEN**, the JAMMA's Green (**G**) pin is also correclty referenced (**N**) and mislabeled as **BLUE**
